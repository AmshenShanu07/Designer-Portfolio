# Designer Portfolio
This is a model portfolio for digital designers #LearnSomeThingNew

## Creation Process

I learned Figma few days a go, So i desided to do some design and make it into life
So i got a model beautiful model orginally designed by  <a href='http://www.mirrom14.com/2016/07/make-a-stylish-portfolio-website-design-with-grain-texture-in-photoshop.html'>mirror14</a>, So I tried to clone it pixel by pixel, It was a five days process


### Day One
I spend some time on researching about designing strategies. I finally end up by desiding to clone some others designs(Thats how you improve). So i started to search  on google for great designings at the end of the search, I found this design it was pretty cool, The owner of this design is actually designed this website in Photoshope and he has a great video on that (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRQC4fLNHs'>Link To Video</a>).

### Day Two 
So on Day one i got the desing of the website, I decided to design this website in figma first, As a process i gather some some good images from unsplash and i started designing it, The tough part in designing this website was with the gradient and and image filters. At the end of the day i cloned his designing exactly on figma this some changes, You can check out my work on <a href='https://www.figma.com/file/Nlzax1mHijynKtNXQnsIcV/Designer-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1'>Figma</a>

### Day Three 
Now i finised my designing process, so now i should make it live, i decided to use sass with Html, Sass is a great game changer in this generation it will simplify css, I am using VsCode as my text editor, but i did't get any good compiling extension to compile sass, so i used some of the top extension refered by the google but its not compling corretly, the main problem i faced is that background image is not compling to css and some of the other things too.. The website is finally ready and there was only a little html and a lot of css code, Although i did't make it responsive may be you can expect that in future, <a href="https://amshenshanu07.github.io/Designer-Portfolio/" >Live link to the website</a>

## Some tips from my side
-  you should have a basic knowledge about html and css
- don't go for designing and front-end development at same time as a  begnner
- make wireframing and prototypes in figma and build a strong base in designing
- take some model and try to designing it exactly same
